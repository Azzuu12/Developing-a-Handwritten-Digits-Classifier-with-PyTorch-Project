# Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch Project
 
 ## Project Overview:
 In this project, we aim to develop a proof-of-concept system for optical character recognition (OCR) focused on handwritten digits. Utilizing the MNIST database, which contains a vast collection of handwritten digit samples, we will build a neural network capable of recognizing and classifying these digits.

## Objectives:
Preprocess the MNIST dataset for effective digit recognition.
Construct a neural network using PyTorch, featuring at least two hidden layers.
Train and tune the neural network to optimize its performance on the dataset.

## Steps:
# Data Preprocessing: 
Transform the dataset into a suitable format for input into the neural network, including normalization and tensor conversion.

# Model Design: 
Create a neural network architecture that outputs prediction probabilities for each of the ten digit classes using the softmax function.

# Training: 
Implement a training loop to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters, aiming for a classification accuracy of at least 90%.

# Evaluation: 
Test the model using a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance and make necessary adjustments to hyperparameters.
This project will provide valuable insights into the application of deep learning techniques for image classification tasks.
